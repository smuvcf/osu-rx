## Status
Development of osu!rx has ended, it is now feature locked. This means that there will only be compatibility and bug fixes, new features won't be implemented.

[Click here](#what-can-i-do-to-help-osurx) to see how you can help the development of osu!rx

## Features
- **Automatic beatmap detection:** you don't need to alt-tab from osu! to select beatmap manually, osu!rx will do all the dirty work for you.

- **Playstyles:** osu!rx has 3 most(?) popular built-in playstyles that you can select!
  - Singletap
  - Alternate
  - TapX
  
- **Hit Timing randomization:** osu!rx automatically randomizes click timings depending on whether you're currently alternating or not.

- **HitScan:** it will scan for current cursor position and determine whether relax should hit right now, earlier or later.

- **Customizability:** pretty much everything that is already fully implemented can be configured to better suit your needs.

- **[osu!rewrite](https://github.com/xxCherry/osu-rewrite) support:** osu!rx is the first [osu!rewrite](https://github.com/xxCherry/osu-rewrite)-compatible hack ever!

## Frequently asked questions
### I downloaded osu!rx but there's only folders, .cs and .sln files and no osu!rx.exe file!
You downloaded the source code. If you have no idea what to do with it, re-read the [Running osu!rx section](#running-osurx) to find the download link of the precompiled version.  

### Can i still use osu!rx on private servers?
ew. I mean, you can use it on [kawata](https://kawata.pw/), but you should feel dirty, if you're cheating on private servers that don't allow this.

### Will you ever release undetected version?
No.
